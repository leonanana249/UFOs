## Overview of Project 
Design a dynamic webpage to allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 
## Results 
When search for certain criteria, please ensure the format follows exact same format as the below example. When enter date 1/1/2010, users can see a filtered list. Then users can further filter down by other criteria based on the selections available on the right table.

## Summary
The major drawback of the webpage is that every criteria is format sensitive. Users have to get familiar with available selections on the list. 
### Recommendations 
•	To further code on different scenarios on each type of criteria to compensate different formats. 
•	To create a drop-down list in the search bars to allow users to select directly
